## Usage
At first launch of iBacon you won't see any beacons showing up. You only see
beacons in the overview list after adding them by entering a UUID.
To achieve this you have to press the plus Button in the top right corner.
You can enter the UUID manualy or by scanning a QR code.

After this you will see a new beacon in the list. Now select it to set the
prefered settings.

Note: You wil only see and be able to edit beacons in list when you are in
range of them.
